# Final_Project_Team_8
## Self-Assessment:
- My role included active participation in deciding which dataset to use between 3 contenders presented by team memmbers. Thereafter I was assigned the to write a description of     the machine learning module and update the README file in git. I was time-keeper when the team rehearsed for the final presenation. I attended all our team meetings at which       discussions and reviews of the project segments and decisions for next steps were agreed.
- My background is not computer science related, in fact I had zero coding experience when I joined this bootcamp. In spite of all the support I got I still had a huge backlog of   homework assignments and unit assessments throughout the project duration. This was my greatest personal challenge. I overcame this by dedicating long hours to the course.
## Team Assessment:
- At the outset we identified a member would become a coordinator of sorts lasting through the project duration. The team also agreed to communicate via Slack channel (remembering   to include our mentor Ms Riya Dalal), WhatsApp, Microsoft Team meetigs outside the regular breakout rooms in virtual class.
- A major strength of this team was that members were respectful of one another despite their diversity.
